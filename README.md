# Books
A simple book review app made using android studio,uses kotlin and xml.
It allows users to navigate in various fragments using the navigation drawer,uses an API to access the list of books and their details
This application also uses volley and picasso libraries.
The users can save the favourite ones and also review theses bookks.
IN future I would like to add a chat scheme in the app in which a group of friends can together discuss and enjoy the pleasure of reading some amazing works and reccomennd it to their peer too.
